## To recap, MongoDB is made up of databases which contain collections. 
### A collection is made up of documents.
### Each document is made up of fields.
### Collections can be indexed, which improves lookup and sorting performances.
### Finally , when we get data from MongoDB we do so through a cursor whose actual execution is delayed until necessary.
