- INFO: by default it build the transcoder image from the master branch of crunchtranscoder-server.git branch.
- INFO: if you want to customize the branch or tag name run ./run.sh -g <branch-name> -t <tag>.

 each job is atomic in nature, i.e. either all the streaming have been transcoded or none, So if some job is stopped while transcoding is in progress then job needs to be restarted? - Scope to check the functionality.

 type : permissible values are ULB and FBCP.
 target_percentage_reduction - Values lies between [10 to 51) , default value is 50.

I mean the transcode the image in such a way that it can be rearranged in later point of time.
